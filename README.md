Welcome to my GitHub Profile. I am currently in 3rd Year in Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. Dedicated to any project that I handle, full of curiosity to explore different programming languages, and I am energized in challenges that I need to solve.
