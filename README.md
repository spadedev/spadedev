### Mabuhay! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub Profile. I am currently in 2nd Year in Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I have experience in Python, C#, and Java Programming. Dedicated to any project that I handle, full of curiosity to explore different programming languages, and I am energized in challenges that I need to solve. I am currently working on a project for our final requirement in mobile development about tracking of moods.
